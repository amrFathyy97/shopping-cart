# Simple Shopping Cart Application

This is a basic shopping cart application built with React that uses React Context for state management and stores data in `localStorage`. The application also utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling. The primary goal of this project was to experiment with functionality rather than focusing on UI/UX design.

## Features

- **Add to Cart:** Users can add products to their shopping cart.
- **Remove from Cart:** Users can remove individual items from the cart.
- **Clear Cart:** Users can clear all items from the cart.
- **Persistent Cart:** The cart data is stored in `localStorage`, so it remains even after refreshing the page.
- **Pagination:** The cart items are displayed with pagination, allowing users to navigate through the list of items.

## Tech Stack

- **React:** Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **React Context:** Used for state management across components.
- **localStorage:** Used to persist the cart data between sessions.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amrFathyy97/shopping-cart.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd shopping-cart
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- The application is a simple shopping cart where you can add, remove, and clear items.
- All cart data is stored in `localStorage`, ensuring that your cart persists even after refreshing the page.

## Notes

- **UI/UX:** The focus of this project was on implementing the core functionality, so the UI is minimal and not fully optimized.
- **Customization:** You can easily customize the UI by modifying the Tailwind CSS classes in the components.
